Nora joined the Plesa Lab as an undergraduate in 2019, and since then has worked on a variety of projects, both experimental and computational. She is is now an MSc student in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Master's Program. Nora is interested in biochemistry, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and DNA nanotechnology. Nora is excited about developing scalable directed evolution strategies to engineer proteins.
