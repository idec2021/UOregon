Proteins are the molecular machinery which enable functional diversity across organisms. Bioengineers recognize the potential of these natural machines and repurpose them for applications ranging from drug delivery to greener chemical synthesis.

A significant barrier to using proteins in medicine and industry is that proteins function best in living cells from their native organism, and frequently lose function in a different context. This necessitates innovative techniques to modify and optimize proteins for novel functions and conditions.
