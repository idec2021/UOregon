Proteins are the molecular machinery which enable functional diversity across organisms. Bioengineers recognize the potential of these natural machines and repurpose them for applications ranging from drug delivery to greener chemical synthesis.

A significant barrier to using proteins in medicine and industry is that proteins function best in living cells from their native organism, and frequently lose function in a different context. This necessitates innovative techniques to modify and optimize proteins for novel functions and conditions.

Directed evolution allows scientists to guide and accelerate the mutational path of DNA, genetic material which encodes proteins, towards desired functions. Current approaches to directed evolution require cycles of manual DNA mutation *in vitro* to develop a library of differentially mutated genes, followed by expression of the mutant library in cells to assess functional outcomes. This time-consuming, labor-intensive process limits our ability to evolve many proteins quickly in parallel.

Continuous approaches to directed evolution bypass cyclic *in vitro* mutation, allowing mutation to take place within cells over several generations without manual interference. These methods rely on error-prone DNA replication machinery which introduce mutations to the gene of interest (GOI). However, if error-prone machinery interacts with and damages the host genome, the cell dies, limiting the number of evolutionary generations.
