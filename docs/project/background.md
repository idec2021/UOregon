# DiversiPhi29
Biological protein-based systems have diverse applications, from targeted drug delivery to sustainable textile manufacturing. A significant barrier to using proteins in medicine and industry is that proteins have evolved to function best in a living cell from their native organism, and frequently lose function in a different context. Directed evolution is a powerful approach to engineering and optimizing proteins. However, traditional approaches to directed evolution are time-consuming and labor intensive, limiting our ability to evolve many proteins quickly in parallel. DiversiPhi29 

Continuous approaches to directed evolution bypass cyclic *in vitro* mutation, instead allowing mutation to take place within cells over several generations without manual interference.

Replication takes place independently of the host.
