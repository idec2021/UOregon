# Protocol 
1. Get a bucket of ice out! 

### How to Make Cells Electrocompetent 
1. Start with an overnight culture , aliquot out into 5 mL tubes 
2. Spin down 3,000 g for 4 minutes 
3. Discard supernatant 
4. Resuspend pellet in 700 uL sterile MilliQ H2O 
5. Vortex 5-6 seconds, transfer into epi 
6. Spin down 8,000 g 3 minutes 
7. Discard supernatant, add 700 uL MilliQ H2O
8. Vortex 2-3 seconds  
9. Spin down 8,000 g 3 minutes 
10. Discard supernatant, add 40 uL MilliQ H2O 
11. Flick tube gently to resuspend cells 
12. Add 1-2uL of 20-50 ng/uL plasmid DNA ( so total of 20-100 ng )
14. Pipette cells + DNA into electroporation cuvette on ice 
15. Gently tap down on bench to remove bubbles (Do NOT want bubbles)

### If starting from stock cells 
1. Thaw DH5alpha cells on ice for 10 min. 
3. Add 25 uL stock cells to epi tube 
4. Add 1 uL plasmid DNA to the same epi tube 
5. Mix by gently tapping 4-5x
6. Pipette 26 uL mixture into electroporation cuvette on ice 

### Once cells+DNA are in Electroporation Cuvette 
1. Place cuvette into holder and Zap cells 
2. Immediately add 950 uL SOC to cuvette, pipette up/down to mix 
3. Transfer cells to tube and stick in 37C shaked for 1 hour 
4. Plate 100uL on corresponding plates ( dilute with LB if necessary)
