# Protocol 

### Things to think about before starting:

1. Make sure you make a gel big enough for all of your DNA + ladders
2. Make sure there is a ladder every 9 wells
3. Look on Notion guidelines for what % gel to make based on DNA size 
4. Look on Notion guidelines for what Voltage to run gel at based on size 

### Small Gel Tray (using 1% gel as example)
1. Measure out 0.3g of Agar 
2. Use graduated cylinder to measure 30 mL TAE buffer
3. Put in microwave for 15 second intervals at a time stirring until no granuals can be detected in the liquid 
4. Add 3 uL Sybr Safe to stain 
5. While waiting for gel to cool, balance the tray 
6. Once cool pour gel into tray and place 8-15 well comb in liquid and cover with foil to solidify 

### Large Gel Tray (using 1% gel as example)
1. Measure out 0.9g of Agar 
2. Use graduated cylinder to measure 90 mL TAE buffer
3. Put in microwave for 15 second intervals at a time stirring until no granuals can be detected in the liquid 
4. Add 9 uL Sybr Safe to stain 
5. While waiting for gel to cool, balance the tray 
6. Once cool pour gel into tray and place 15-30 well comb in liquid and cover with foil to solidify 

### Ladder
| Loading Dye | Ladder Template | H2O | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 3 uL |  1 uL  | 8 uL | 12 uL |
 
### Sample 
| Loading Dye | DNA ( 300 ng) | H2O | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 3 uL |  # uL  | # uL | 12-14 uL |

Run all of sample on gel 

100-200 V for 30-60 min depending on size of DNA
