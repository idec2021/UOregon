# Protocol 

### From Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit Protocol
1. Start with an overnight culture from the night before 
2. aliquot out into two 5 mL tubes or 1 mL per Epi Tube 
3. Spin down at 3,000 g for 4 minutes
4. Discard supernatant 
5. Resuspend pellet in 200 uL Plasmid Resuspension Buffer , pipette up and down to ensure no clumps of cells 
6. Add 200 uL Lysis Buffer and gently invert tube 5-6 times (Do not vortex!) incubate for 1 minute
7. Neutralize by adding 400 uL Plasmid Neutralization Buffer, gently invert tube until no more purple is found and a precipitate forms ( Do not vortex!) let incubate for two minutes 
8. Centrifuge 5 minutes at 16,000 g
9. Transfer supernatant to column, centrifuge 1 minute 16,000 g 
10. Add 200 uL wash buffer 1 to column, spin down 1 minute 16,000 g, discard liquid 
11. Add 400 uL wash buffer 2 to column, spin for 1 minute 16,000 g, discard liquid 
12. Transfer column to epi tube add >30 uL elution buffer let sit for 1 minute then centrifuge 1 minute 16,000 g 
13. Take concentration with nanodrop
