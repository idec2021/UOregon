# Protocol 
### Before you begin: 

Label tubes with colony #. 

Get out full pipette set (green, red 20, red 2, blue) 

Get out MultiChannel red 2-20. 

### Resuspend Colonies 

Label tubes like table below. 

Use MC pipette to dispense 100 ul water in # tubes. 

Take a pipette tip and pick up a small amount of bacteria from each of the listed colonies, swirl around colony in water 

### Set up reaction as follows: 

| Mastermix (Apex Red) | FWD Primer | REV Primer 2 | Colony Suspended in H2O | H2O | Total 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| 11 uL | 0.5 uL | 0.5 uL | 2 uL | 8 uL | 22 uL |
| 11 uL | 0.5 uL | 0.5 uL | 2 uL | 8 uL | 22 uL |
| 11 uL | 0.5 uL | 0.5 uL | 2 uL | 8 uL | 22 uL |
| 11 uL | 0.5 uL | 0.5 uL | 2 uL | 8 uL | 22 uL |

Use 0 uL of Colony H20 and 10 uL H20 as negative control 

PCR Cycling: 

1. Initial Denature: 95C for 5 min (causes lysis) 

2. Denature 95 C for 30 sec 

3. Anneal temp. found using NEB Tm Calc for 30 sec 

4. Extend 72 C for 10 sec per kb

Go to step 2 for 30 cycles 

5.Final extension 72 C for 5 min
