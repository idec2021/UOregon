# Protocol 

### Materials needed: 
1. Clean 2L plastic beaker with handle OR clean 1L or 2L glass bottle 
2. BD Difco LB Broth, Miller (white plastic container with blue top) 
3. BD Bacto Agar 
4. Plastic petri dishes (100mm normal size, or 150mm large size, or 60mm mini size) 
5. Magnetic stir bar 
6. IR thermometer 

 
### Making LB+Agar Mixture 
1. Put a large magnetic stir bar into a: clean 2L plastic beaker with handle OR a 1L or 2L glass bottle. 
2. Measure out 25g of LB Broth per Liter (50g for 2L) in a plastic tray on the scale. 
3. Tare the scale again and measure out 15g of Bacto Agar per Liter. 
4. Put the powder into the beaker or bottle and fill it with DI water to 1L or 2L. 
5. If using beaker, place on cold hotplate and using magnetic stirring to dissolve powder. If using bottles, shake very well or use magnetic stirrer. 
6. If using beaker, place aluminum foil over the entire top. If using bottles, place aluminum foil around the top cap such that you can take the top cap off and put in on the bench and the bottom of the cap will not touch the table, only the aluminum foil will. 
7. Put autoclave tape on the aluminum foil. 
8. Label contents and date on autoclave tape. 
9. When putting top on bottle it should be loose, otherwise bottle may explode in the autoclave. 
10. Place the beaker or bottle(s) into an autoclave tray. 
11. Autoclave the bottle(s). The duration depends on volume. Typically 1L needs 30min at 121C (not including ramp time). Larger volume needs longer time. You need to account for the fact that large volumes need longer time for entire volume to reach temperature because of the high specific capacity of water. Note that certain autoclave settings may cause the contents to boil over. 
12. If using bottles, while waiting for autoclave prepare a 60C water bath. No need if using beaker. 
13. Take tray out of autoclave (HOT! use golves) 
14. Make sure autoclave tape is dark. If not something went wrong. 
15. If using bottle place it into hot water bath, submerging about 75%. Don't let dirty bath water get near mouth of the bottle. Dont place the bottle into the water bath immediately after taking it out of the autoclave since it will still be very hot and can actually warm up the water bath. Wait for it to cool a bit ~65C. If using beaker place on cold hotplate, very low stirring ~40rpm (make sure stirring is not making bubbles). 
16. Use the IR thermometer to check the temperature of the bottle or beaker. 
17. Wait for the media to cool down to at least 55C to 60C before adding antibiotic. Using 1000X antibiotic add 1mL of antibiotic per Liter of media. When adding antibiotic make sure you use aseptic technique. So either do this near a flame or in a BSC. 
18. After adding antibiotic, magnetic stir for 1 min (<80rpm so no bubbles) after to make sure antibiotic is mixed in well. 

### Pouring the Plates 
1. Get your plates and start pouring the media into them, opening one at a time. Pour as little as you can. I usually pour not enough to cover entire petri dish then gently tilt dish so that media covers everything. Avoid bubbles! For regular 100mm plates I usually pour in stacks of 5 plates. If you stack plates it prevents water condensation on the lids. 
2. Wait until plates have solidified and turn them upside down. 
3. Let the plates dry at least 2 hr before using. Fresh plates can be left at RT for a few days or placed into plastic bags (these come with petri dishes) and put into the cold room or fridge. 
5. If you need to test your plates, streak out a strain with correct antibiotic and one with wrong antibiotic and check for correct growth after overnight growth.
