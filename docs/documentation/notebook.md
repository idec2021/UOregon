# Lab notebooks
## July 1st
Golden Gate Assembly (set link to GGA protocol file) of Phi29 Terminal protein (TP) ,Single stranded binding protein (SSBP) and Double Stranded binding protein (DSBP)+pGS21a backbone with Phi29 DNA Polymerase(DNAP) 
DpnI digest of backbone
Cleanup Assembly:
| Concentration |
| ------------- |
|  look in Noras notebook ng/uL |

Make Agar+LB plates with Carbenicillin 

## July 2nd
Transform Phi29-pGS21a into DH5alpha using electroporation protocol(link electroporation protocol) 
| Component   | Volume |
