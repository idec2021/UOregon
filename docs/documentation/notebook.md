# Lab notebooks
## July 1st
Golden Gate Assembly (set link to GGA protocol file) of Phi29 Terminal protein (TP) ,Single stranded binding protein (SSBP) and Double Stranded binding protein (DSBP)+pGS21a backbone with Phi29 DNA Polymerase(DNAP) 

DpnI digest of backbone

Cleanup Assembly:
| Concentration |
| ------------- |
|  look in Noras notebook ng/uL |

Make Agar+LB plates with Carbenicillin 

## July 2nd
Transform Phi29-pGS21a into DH5alpha using electroporation protocol(link electroporation protocol) 
| Component   | Volume |

1 uL plasmid, 50 uL cells 

Serial Dilution using 1:10 ratio 3x 

Plate 100uL on Carb 

## July 7th 
Make an overnight culture with Colony plated on Carb and T7 cells with no colony (from stock) 

## July 8th
T7 OD600: 4.91

Col17 OD600: 4.62 

Induce with 3 different concentrations of IPTG to test for protein toxicity on the cells by checking OD600 in a plate reader for 16 hours
