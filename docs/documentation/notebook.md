# Lab notebooks
## July 1st
Golden Gate Assembly (set link to GGA protocol file) of Phi29 Terminal protein (TP) ,Single stranded binding protein (SSBP) and Double Stranded binding protein (DSBP)+pGS21a backbone with Phi29 DNA Polymerase(DNAP) 
DpnI digest of backbone
Cleanup Assembly:
| Concentration |
| ------------- |
|  look in Noras notebook ng/uL |

Make Agar+LB plates with Carbenicillin 

## July 2nd
Transform Phi29-pGS21a into DH5alpha using electroporation protocol(link electroporation protocol) 
| Component   | Volume |
| ----| ---- |
| DNA | 2uL |
| DH5a | 25uL |

Plate 100uL on Carb 

## July 3rd 
Run Colony PCR (link protocol) on 15 colonies to ensure insert length using DH5a as control

Create an overnight culture with 10mL LB+ scrape 1 colony with pipette tip and eject into test tube+ 10uL Carb 
Let shake in 37Â°C for 12-16 hours overnight 

## July 4th 
 Miniprep overnight culture
 Elute: 30 uL
 | Colony  | Concentration |
| ----| ---- |
| 13 | 53.4 ng/uL |
| 17 | 65.6 ng/uL|

Digest with KpnI+NdeI to confirm length
