Team Lead Nora Kearns Nora joined the Plesa Lab as an undergraduate in 2019, and since then has worked on a variety of projects, both experimental and computational. She is is now an MSc student in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Master's Program, and her research interests include synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and DNA nanotechnology. Nora started the UOregon iDEC team with Dr. Plesa because she is excited about leveraging directed evolution as a strategy to engineer complex proteins. Team Player Amanda Kreppel Amanda joined the Plesa Lab January of 2021 as an undergraduate having little knowledge in Synthetic Biology. Learning new hands on protocols and utilizing E. coli for recombinant gene expression has deeply increased her passion for science. Her research interests also include microbiology and she plans on taking a gap year after she graduates in 2022 before pursuing a masters in biotechnology. Amanda's interest in the Plesa lab\u2019s novel approach to directed evolution drew her to joining the iDEC team.

container with blue top) BD Bacto Agar Plastic petri dishes (100mm normal size, or 150mm large size, or 60mm mini size) Magnetic stir bar IR thermometer Making LB+Agar Mixture Put a large magnetic stir bar into a: clean 2L plastic beaker with handle OR a 1L or 2L glass bottle. Measure out 25g of LB Broth per Liter (50g for 2L) in a plastic tray on the scale. Tare the scale again and measure out 15g of Bacto Agar per Liter. Put the powder into the beaker or bottle and fill it with DI water to 1L or 2L. If using beaker, place on cold hotplate and using magnetic stirring to dissolve powder. If using bottles, shake very well or use magnetic stirrer. If using beaker, place aluminum foil over the entire top. If using bottles, place aluminum foil around the top cap such that you can take the top cap off and put in on the bench and the bottom of the cap will not touch the table, only the aluminum foil will. Put autoclave tape on the aluminum foil. Label contents and date on autoclave tape. When putting top on bottle it should be loose, otherwise bottle may explode in the autoclave. Place the beaker or bottle(s) into an autoclave tray. Autoclave the bottle(s). The duration depends on volume. Typically 1L needs 30min at 121C (not including ramp time). Larger volume needs longer time. You need to account for the fact that large volumes need longer time for entire volume to reach temperature because of the high specific capacity of water. Note that certain autoclave settings may cause the contents to boil over. If using bottles, while waiting for autoclave prepare a 60C water bath. No need if using beaker. Take tray out of autoclave with gloves Make sure autoclave tape is dark. If not something went wrong. If using bottle place it into hot water bath, submerging about 75%. Don't let dirty bath water get near mouth of the bottle. Dont place the bottle into the water bath immediately after taking it out of the autoclave since it will still be very hot and can actually warm up the water bath. Wait for it to cool a bit ~65C. If using beaker place on cold hotplate, very low stirring ~40rpm (make sure stirring is not making bubbles). Use the IR thermometer to check the temperature of the bottle or beaker. Wait for the media to cool down to at least 55C to 60C before adding antibiotic. Using 1000X antibiotic add 1mL of antibiotic per Liter of media. When adding antibiotic make sure you use aseptic technique. So either do this near a flame or in a BSC. After adding antibiotic, magnetic stir for 1 min (<80rpm so no bubbles) after to make sure antibiotic is mixed in well. Pouring the Plates Get your plates and start pouring the media into them, opening one at a time. Pour as little as you can. I usually pour not enough to cover entire petri dish then gently tilt dish so that media covers everything. Avoid bubbles! For regular 100mm plates I usually pour in stacks of 5 plates. If you stack plates it prevents water condensation on the lids. Wait until plates have solidified and turn them upside down. Let the plates dry at least 2 hr before using. Fresh plates can be left at RT for a few days or placed into plastic bags (these come with petri dishes) and put into the cold room or fridge.","title":"Protocol"},{"location":"documentation/Plating%20Protocol/#protocol","text":"","title":"Protocol"},{"location":"documentation/Plating%20Protocol/#materials-needed","text":"Clean 2L plastic beaker with handle OR clean 1L or 2L glass bottle BD Difco LB Broth, Miller (white plastic container with blue top) BD Bacto Agar Plastic petri dishes (100mm normal size, or 150mm large size, or 60mm mini size) Magnetic stir bar IR thermometer","title":"Materials needed:"},{"location":"documentation/Plating%20Protocol/#making-lbagar-mixture","text":"Put a large magnetic stir bar into a: clean 2L plastic beaker with handle OR a 1L or 2L glass bottle.

A significant barrier to using proteins in medicine and industry is that proteins have evolved to function best in a living cell from their native organism, and frequently lose function in a different context. This necessitates innovative techniques to modify and optimize natural proteins for novel functions and conditions. Protein engineering involves mutating a protein's encoding DNA and observing the functional outcomes. However, the relationships between sequence and function are often unpredictable, and the mutational space for a given protein is virtually limitless. DiversiPhi29 is an approach to protein engineering which optimizes the scale and speed at which sequence space can be explored by limiting the necessity for manual mutation. Directed Evolution Directed evolution allows scientists to guide and accelerate the mutational path of a sequence, in a random or targeted manner, towards a certain functional or phenotypic ideal. Current approaches to directed evolution consist of rounds of mutation in vitro to develop a library of differentially mutated genes, followed by expression of the mutant library in vivo to assess phenotypic outcomes. Variants are screened for a select function, and the most suitable variants undergo further rounds of mutation, expression, and screening until a suitable phenotype is achieved. This process is time-consuming and labor intensive, necessitating multiple transformation steps during which genes of interest are inserted in cells for replication and expression. Each transformation step also results in a loss of library diversity, or a \u201cbottleneck,\u201d as not all gene variants are successfully taken up by cells. As such, these approaches are limited in their ability to characterize many sequence-function relationships in parallel. Continuous Directed Evolution Continuous methods for directed evolution circumvent many of these limitations, allowing multiple cycles of mutation to take place entirely in vivo without manual interference. Mutagenesis in continuous evolution relies on an increase in the mutational rate of the host cells above typical genomic error rates. This can be done through chemical mutagenesis, with alkylating agents, UV irradiation, or base analogues (Packer & Liu, 2015) . More recently, mutational frequency has been increased by deactivating host proofreading enzymes1 or mutating the host DNA Polymerase to reduce copying fidelity (Greener et al, 1997) . However, both of these methods generate unwanted mutations in the host genome. Over time, mutations accumulate in essential genes and kill the host, limiting the number of evolutionary generations possible. Such short experimental durations prevent access to certain adaptations of interest that require long mutational paths. Orthogonal Replication for Directed Evolution Orthogonal replication architectures are those in which replication of a gene of interest and host genomic replication occur by separate machinery and mechanism. Orthogonal replication applied to directed evolution provides the advantages of continuous in vivo mutagenesis while maintaining stability of the host genome. Previously established systems have relied on an error-prone DNA polymerase which interacts specifically with an engineered DNA construct, and cannot interact with host genomic DNA (Ravikumar et al, 2014) . This allows high mutation rates on a gene of interest without damaging the host. The primary advantage of such a system is its ability to sustain long experimental durations, allowing a gene to evolve over hundreds of generations. Bacteriophage Phi29 The initiation of DNA synthesis conventionally relies on priming by a short sequence of DNA or RNA, which provides a 3\u2019 hydroxyl group for DNA Polymerase to extend from. In several phages, a terminal protein serves as a primer for genomic replication (Salas, 1991) . Bacteriophage Phi29, a virus which infects Bacillus subtilis , represents the most extensively studied example of terminal protein-primed replication. Critical to this mechanism are the Phi29 Origins of Replication (ORIs) which flank the genome and allow cooperative binding of the Phi29 DNA Polymerase and Terminal Protein (Mencia et al, 2011) . DiversiPhi29 repurposes the transcriptional machinery of bacteriophage Phi29 for orthogonal replication, using E. coli as a cellular chassis. Our protein-primed replication mechanism differs from the mechanism used by the E. coli DNA polymerase to replicate the E. coli genome, which enables isolation of an error-prone Phi29 DNA Polymerase (DNAP) from the host genome. In DiversiPhi29, the Phi29 ORIs flank a gene of interest on a linear plasmid so that the Phi29 DNA Polymerase and priming Terminal Protein replicate the gene of interest as they would replicate the Phi29 genome. ## DiversiPhi29 Once we have established replication of a linear plasmid carrying a gene of interest, we will modify the Phi29 DNA Polymerase to reduce its copying fidelity. The low-fidelity Phi29 polymerase will perform error-prone replication of the linear plasmid while the host polymerase carries out normal replication of the genome. ## Tunable Mutagenesis In future work we plan to create a system to tune and control the rate of mutagenesis on a linear plasmid by alternating expression of a low and high-fidelity polymerase. Expression of each will be under control of a different inducer or repressor, such that high expression of one coincides with low expression of the other. Over several generations, a linear plasmid will alternate expression between the low and high-fidelity polymerase, such that the cumulative error rate can be controlled. References (1) Packer, M.

Graphics were created using BioRender","title":" References "},{"location":"project/results/","text":"Results Objective The objective of our work was to establish orthogonal replication of a linear plasmid (pL) in E. coli using a minimal set of replication proteins from bacteriopage \u027829. We first built a vector plasmid, p\u027829 , carrying the genes encoding each of these proteins, and expressed it in E. coli. \u027829 Toxicity We screened for toxicity of the \u027829 proteins in E. coli by performing an induction assay. Expression of the \u027829 proteins only occurs in the presence of the inducer Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Any detrimental effects posed to the host by the \u027829 proteins would be indicated by slowed growth in the cells expressing the \u027829 proteins in the presence of IPTG. Cells carrying p\u027829 were induced at 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mM IPTG and compared to the growth of DH5\u03b1 cells (orange) at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. Figure 1. Doubling Time of Cells Expressing p\u027829 Growth of p\u027829 cells (blue) when induced at 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG compared to growth of DH5a cells (orange) at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. As IPTG induction level increased from 0 mM to 1.0 mM, doubling time slowed by 24.2%, which suggests that successfully expressing Phi29 proteins may be complicated by their potential for toxicity to the host. Depending on a protein\u2019s characteristics and function, overexpressing recombinant proteins in E. coli can interfere with cell survival and proliferation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014) . Increased doubling time indicates that Phi29 cells divert metabolic resources away from normal replication to make Phi29 proteins. The minor increase in doubling time from 0.1 to 1.0 mM suggests that p\u027829 expression reached saturation at 0.1 mM IPTG. Replication of Linear Plasmid by Phi29 Proteins Cells induced at varying levels of IPTG were then transformed with a linear plasmid (pL) carrying DHFR R67, a variant of dihydrofolate reductase which confers high levels of resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim. Cells both with (pL+) and without pL (pL-), were plated on media with IPTG concentrations corresponding to induction level. A negative control not transformed with pL was also plated on each IPTG condition. As expected, pL+ and pL- cells plated on 10 ug/mL trimethoprim and without IPTG did not grow. Although growth was observed on one of four replica plates from the 10 ug/mL trimethoprim/1.0mM IPTG/ pL+ condition, no growth was seen on the other 3 plates. Significant growth on all four replica plates was only observed on the 5 ug/mL trimethoprim and 0.1 mM IPTG condition, both with and without pL. . The 50% inhibitory concentration of DHFR R67 to trimethoprim is 5.8 g/L 6. If pL replication by Phi29 proteins were successful, the expressed DHFR R67 would easily confer resistance of 10 ug/mL (0.01 g/L). The growth observed at lower trimethoprim resistance regardless of pL presence suggests a high frequency of escape mutations, in which the host naturally acquires resistance to the antibiotic through genomic mutations rather than expressing the plasmid carrying resistance. This was confirmed by running a colony PCR (Fig. 3) to assess the presence of pL in the surviving colonies. A colony from each of the conditions under which growth was observed was tested. The inverted terminal repeats in the Phi29 ORIs make PCR amplification of the entire pL impossible, so a PCR of the middle sequence, DHFR R67, was done and the product was visualized on a gel. Negative PCR results from all colonies verified that cells acquired resistance to trimethoprim through a separate mechanism independent of pL replication by Phi29 proteins. Colony PCR also verified that pL did not integrate into the genome, as DFHR R67 would have been amplified off the 0.1 mM IPTG -pL colonies. Figure 2. Colony PCR for DHFR R67 Lane 1: 100 bp ladder. Lane 2: no template negative control. Lane 3: 0.1 mM IPTG/5ug/mL Tri /pL++. Lane 4: 1.0 mM IPTG/10 ug/mL/pL+. Lane 5: 0.1 mM IPTG/5 ug/mL/pL-. Lane 6: DHFR R67 template positive control Transitioning Expression to pGS\u027829 and T7 Express The Phi29 TP, DSBP, and SSBP were ligated into an alternative plasmid backbone, pGS21a , which carried the wildtype \u027829 DNAP with 6XHis and GST tags to enable easier purification. In the resulting plasmid, pGS\u027829 , expression of the Phi29 proteins is under control of a T7 promoter. pGS21a was transformed into E. coli strain T7 express (C2566H), which expresses T7 polymerase in the lac operon. T7 express is also optimized for protein expression. Metabolic Burden of Phi29 Proteins in T7 We screened for toxicity of the \u027829 proteins in T7 by performing an induction assay identical to the induction performed on DH5a cells expresing p\u027829. We anticipated that, because T7 was an strain better suited for protein expression than DH5a, the growth time would be less severely impeded by expresion of the \u027829 proteins. Figure 3. Doubling Time of T7 Cells Expressing pGS\u027829 Growth of T7 cells expressing p\u027829 (blue) when induced at 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mM IPTG compared to growth of DH5\u03b1 cells (orange) at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. T7 cells expressing pGS\u027829 were induced at increasing concentrations of IPTG to express the Phi29 proteins. As IPTG induction level increased from 0 mM to 1.0 mM, doubling time slowed by 7.85%, from 106.1 \u00b1 2.49 min to 114.45 \u00b1 3.00 min. Consistent with our expectation, doubling time in T7 express was significantly faster than in DH5\u03b1. T7 cells induced at varying levels of IPTG were then transformed with pL. Cells both with (pL+) and without pL (pL-), were plated on media with IPTG concentrations corresponding to induction level (0 mM, 0.1 mM, or 1 mM). A negative control not transformed with pL was also plated on each IPTG condition. To avoid escape mutations, trimethoprim concentration was increased to 0.5 mg/mL (a 50 fold increase from the first trial with DH5\u03b1). No growth was observed on any of the plates, indicating that replication of pL by the Phi29 proteins was unsuccessful. To determine whether the Phi29 proteins were actually being expressed in T7, a protein gel was run on cells induced at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. Proteins bands were only clear in the sample expressed at 0.1 mM IPTG. A distinct band at the molecular weight of the terminal protein (31 kD) was observed, but it was difficult to discern if bands at 95, 13, and 12 kD were distinct from bands in the T7 negative control. Figure 4. Protein Gel of T7 Cells Expressing pGS\u027829 induced at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. T7 cells not expressing pGS\u027829 was run as a control. Far left and right lanes are the Precision Plus Protein Ladder, and bands at the expected molecular weights are marked: DSBP: 12 kD, SSBP: 13 kD, TP: 31 kD, GST-tagged DNAP: 95 kD. Given the change in doubling time of cells expressing pGS\u027829 (Fig. 3), and the protein gel (Fig. 7) which indicted potential expression of the \u027829 proteins, it was hypothesized that the \u027829 proteins, it was hypothesized that the \u027829 proteins likely were expressed but were not interating successfully wih pL, potentially as the result of deleterious interactions with heterolosou host proteins. To study the protein-protein interactions between E. coli and \u027829, and rationally design the \u027829 proteins to avoid the would not have been feasible, so we proceeded with randomized mutagenesis. THe pGS\u027829 backbone was amplified normally with PCR, and different sets of the replication proteins were amplified with error-prone PCR (EP PCR) to introduce base substitutions at a rate of ~10\u207b\u2074 substitutions per replicated base (Packer and Liu, 2015) . Successful amplification was validated with gel electrophoresis (Fig 5). All amplicons were the expected length. In future work, mutations will be evaluated using Sanger sequencing.

Expression of the \u027829 proteins only occurs in the presence of the inducer Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Any detrimental effects posed to the host by the \u027829 proteins would be indicated by slowed growth in the cells expressing the \u027829 proteins in the presence of IPTG. Cells carrying p\u027829 were induced at 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mM IPTG and compared to the growth of DH5\u03b1 cells (orange) at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. Figure 1. Doubling Time of Cells Expressing p\u027829 Growth of p\u027829 cells (blue) when induced at 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG compared to growth of DH5a cells (orange) at 0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM IPTG. As IPTG induction level increased from 0 mM to 1.0 mM, doubling time slowed by 24.2%, which suggests that successfully expressing Phi29 proteins may be complicated by their potential for toxicity to the host. Depending on a protein\u2019s characteristics and function, overexpressing recombinant proteins in E. coli can interfere with cell survival and proliferation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014) . Increased doubling time indicates that Phi29 cells divert metabolic resources away from normal replication to make Phi29 proteins. The minor increase in doubling time from 0.1 to 1.0 mM suggests that p\u027829 expression reached saturation at 0.1 mM IPTG.","title":" \u027829 Toxicity "},{"location":"project/results/#replication-of-linear-plasmid-by-phi29-proteins","text":"Cells induced at varying levels of IPTG were then transformed with a linear plasmid (pL) carrying DHFR R67, a variant of dihydrofolate reductase which confers high levels of resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim. Cells both with (pL+) and without pL (pL-), were plated on media with IPTG concentrations corresponding to induction level. A negative control not transformed with pL was also plated on each IPTG condition. As expected, pL+ and pL- cells plated on 10 ug/mL trimethoprim and without IPTG did not grow. Although growth was observed on one of four replica plates from the 10 ug/mL trimethoprim/1.0mM IPTG/ pL+ condition, no growth was seen on the other 3 plates. Significant growth on all four replica plates was only observed on the 5 ug/mL trimethoprim and 0.1 mM IPTG condition, both with and without pL. . The 50% inhibitory concentration of DHFR R67 to trimethoprim is 5.8 g/L 6. If pL replication by Phi29 proteins were successful, the expressed DHFR R67 would easily confer resistance of 10 ug/mL (0.01 g/L). The growth observed at lower trimethoprim resistance regardless of pL presence suggests a high frequency of escape mutations, in which the host naturally acquires resistance to the antibiotic through genomic mutations rather than expressing the plasmid carrying resistance. This was confirmed by running a colony PCR (Fig. 3) to assess the presence of pL in the surviving colonies. A colony from each of the conditions under which growth was observed was tested. The inverted terminal repeats in the Phi29 ORIs make PCR amplification of the entire pL impossible, so a PCR of the middle sequence, DHFR R67, was done and the product was visualized on a gel. Negative PCR results from all colonies verified that cells acquired resistance to trimethoprim through a separate mechanism independent of pL replication by Phi29 proteins. Colony PCR also verified that pL did not integrate into the genome, as DFHR R67 would have been amplified off the 0.1 mM IPTG -pL colonies. Figure 2. Colony PCR for DHFR R67 Lane 1: 100 bp ladder.

We anticipated that, because T7 was an strain better suited for protein expression than DH5a, the growth time would be less severely impeded by expresion of the \u027829 proteins. Figure 3.

T7 cells expressing pGS\u027829 were induced at increasing concentrations of IPTG to express the Phi29 proteins.

Consistent with our expectation, doubling time in T7 express was significantly faster than in DH5\u03b1. T7 cells induced at varying levels of IPTG were then transformed with pL. Cells both with (pL+) and without pL (pL-), were plated on media with IPTG concentrations corresponding to induction level (0 mM, 0.1 mM, or 1 mM). A negative control not transformed with pL was also plated on each IPTG condition. To avoid escape mutations, trimethoprim concentration was increased to 0.5 mg/mL (a 50 fold increase from the first trial with DH5\u03b1). No growth was observed on any of the plates, indicating that replication of pL by the Phi29 proteins was unsuccessful.
